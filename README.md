# FNN-on-FPGA

This is the final project submission for ES204 Digital Systems.

It contains the implementation of a fully connected neural network to classify the MNIST digits dataset on a Nexys 4 DDR board. The Jupyter notebooks used to train the model and the Verilog files containing the FPGA implementation can be found. The details explaining the implementation can be found in the final report.


Burn The project-bram code in folder FNN_BERILOG-CODE. Optain the weights for FNN by running FNN-MODEL-CODE. Finally Send the Weight and Image on which predection need to be done and get the prediction.
